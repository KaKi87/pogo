# pogo [![Build status for Pogo](https://travis-ci.com/sholladay/pogo.svg?branch=master "Build Status")](https://travis-ci.com/sholladay/pogo "Builds")

> Web framework for [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno)

Pogo is an easy to use, safe, and expressive framework for writing web servers and applications. It is inspired by [hapi](https://github.com/hapijs/hapi).

## Why?

 - Designed to encourage reliable and testable applications.
 - Routes are simple, pure functions that return values directly.
 - Automatic JSON responses from objects.

## Usage

```js
import pogo from 'https://denopkg.com/sholladay/pogo@v0.1.0/main.js';

const app = pogo.server({ port : 3000 });

app.route({
    method : 'GET',
    path   : '/hello',
    handler() {
        return 'Hello, world!';
    }
});

app.start();
```

*Note: This project is experimental. It works as documented, but the API is limited. Issues and PRs are welcome!*

## API

### server = pogo.server(option)

Returns a server instance, which can be used to add routes and

#### option

Type: `object`

##### hostname

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `localhost`

Specifies which domain or IP address to listen on. Use `0.0.0.0` to listen on any hostname.

##### port

Type: `number`<br>
Example: `3000`

Specifies which port number to listen on.

### server.route(option)

Adds a route to the server so that the server knows how to respond to requests for the given route.

#### option

Type: `object`

##### method

Type: `string`<br>
Example: `GET`

Any valid HTTP method. Used to limit which requests will trigger the route handler.

##### path

Type: `string`<br>
Example: `/`

Any valid URL path. used to limit which requests will trigger the route handler.

##### handler(request, h)

Type: `function`

 - `request` is a [ServerRequest](https://github.com/denoland/deno_std/blob/e28c9a407951f10d952993ff6a7b248ca11243e1/http/http.ts#L123-L274) instance with properties for `headers`, `method`, `url`, and more.
 - `h` is a response toolkit with methods

The implementation for the route that handles requests. Called when a request is received that matches the `method` and `path` specified in the route configuration.

Should return a string or object. Strings are sent as HTML, objects are sent as JSON (using `JSON.stringify()`). In either case, an appropriate `Content-Type` header will be sent.

### server.start()

Begins listening on the `hostname` and `port` specified when the server was created.

### Response Toolkit

The response toolkit is an object that is passed to route handlers, with utility methods that make it easy to modify the response. For example, you can use it to set headers or a status code.

By convention, this object is assigned to a variable named `h` in code examples.

#### h.body(body)

Sets the response body. This is the same as returning the body directly from the route handler, but it's useful in order to begin a chain with other toolkit methods.

#### h.code(statusCode)

Sets the response status code. Whenever possible, it would be better to use a more specific method instead, such as `h.redirect()`.

*Tip: Use Deno's `status` constants to define the status code.*

```js
import { Status as status } from 'https://deno.land/x/http/http_status.ts';
const handler = (request, h) => {
    return h.status(status.Teapot);
};
```

#### h.created(url)

Sets the response status to `201 Created` and sets the `Location` header to the value of `url`.

Returns the toolkit so other methods can be chained.

#### h.header(name, value)

Sets a response header. Always replaces any existing header of the same name. Headers are case insensitive.

Returns the toolkit so other methods can be chained.

#### h.location(url)

Sets the `Location` header on the response.

Returns the toolkit so other methods can be chained.

#### h.redirect(url)

Sets the response status to `302 Found` and sets the `Location` header to the value of `url`.

Also causes some new toolkit methods to become available for customizing the redirect behavior:

 - `h.permanent()`
 - `h.temporary()`
 - `h.rewritable()`

Returns the toolkit so other methods can be chained.

#### h.permanent()

*Only available after calling the h.redirect() method.*

Sets the response status to `301 Moved Permanently` or `308 Permanent Redirect` based on whether the existing status is considered `rewritable`.

Returns the toolkit so other methods can be chained.

#### h.temporary()

*Only available after calling the h.redirect() method.*

Sets the response status to `302 Found` or `307 Temporary Redirect` based on whether the existing status is considered `rewritable`.

Returns the toolkit so other methods can be chained.

#### h.rewritable(isRewritable)

*Only available after calling the h.redirect() method.*

Sets the response status to `301 Moved Permanently` or `302 Found` based on whether the existing status is a permanent or temporary redirect code. If `isRewritable` is `false`, then the response status will be set to `307 Temporary Redirect` or `308 Permanent Redirect`.

Returns the toolkit so other methods can be chained.
