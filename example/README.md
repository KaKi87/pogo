# Examples

Each directory you see here contains a standalone, working example project that demonstrates Pogo's features and APIs.

To run an example quickly, use `deno https://deno.land/x/pogo/example/<name>/run.js`, where `<name>` is the name of the example. See the `README.md` of each project for further details and instructions on running the example locally so that you can play around with it.

Deno will ask for permission to allow the server to start listening for requests. You can use the `-A` or `--alow-all` flags to grant permission ahead of time when running an example, or simply answer the prompt when it appears.
